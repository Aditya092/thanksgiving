  <h1> Thanksgiving</h1>
    <h2> 2021 has been a big year. It has had many ups and downs. I have met so much people I'm thankful for.</h2>
    <h3> Some people I'm thankful for is:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Having Mr. Kilgore as a teacher because he always checks up on everyone and is one of the only teachers to understand a student feelings throughout school</li>
        <li>My dog, Arya for greeting me every day I come home from school and giving me so much love</li>
        <li>My brother Ashvin for protecting me and being my mentor for so long</li>
        <li>My Mom for always being there</li>
      </ul>
